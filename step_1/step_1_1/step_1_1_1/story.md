# Chapter: Rhythm — The Trial Room

The doors seal behind you. A steady click marks the measure.
Here, clarity matters. Choose, execute, learn.

**TEST A NOTE**
1. Do — Lock the pulse (quarters)
2. Re — Strike the off-beats (eighth “&”s)
3. Mi — Place syncopation (tension)
4. Fa — Hold silence (rests & ties)
5. Sol — Interlock parts (second line)
6. La — Control feel (measured swing)
7. Ti — Anticipate the bar (pickup)
8. Meditate — Save / Resume / Help / Quit

---

## Do
Fix your stance on the quarter: **1 2 3 4**.
No drift. No apology. Keep the grid.

## Re
Hit the “&”s between beats with precision.
If it smears, reset. If it clicks, proceed.

## Mi
Syncopate—place sound where comfort isn’t.
Feel the pull; keep the count uncompromised.

## Fa
Let the rest speak. Do not rush the return.
Discipline is silence held on purpose.

## Sol
Add a second line. Make them cooperate, not collide.
If they argue, you revise until they don’t.

## La
Apply controlled swing—never sloppy, never rigid.
A small bias forward; timing still accountable.

## Ti
Enter before the one; arrive *on* the one.
Anticipation without collapse.

### Meditation
- **Save** — Persist your progress with intention.
- **Resume** — Continue the trial.
- **Help** — Review rules; ambiguity is your opponent.
- **Quit** — Close out properly; exits are logged.

> In this room, failure is feedback.
> Repeat until the pattern holds under pressure.
